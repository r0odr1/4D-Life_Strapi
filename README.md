## Overview :writing_hand:
4D is a web application developed using React, Next.js, and CSS, allowing you as a customer to place home delivery orders for your favorite clothes and/or opt for in-factory pickup. As the owner, you can efficiently manage products. Through Strapi, you can easily add, edit, delete, and view products. You can also manage customers. The application connects to a backend CMS developed developed in Strapi to handle data. This repository contains the backend structure. Here is the link to the frontend repository: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/r0odr1/4D-Life/tree/dev).

### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:

The main challenge of this project is to develop a web application that allows efficient management of products, deliveries, reservations, and the creation of unique users. Key functionalities include:

* Customer User Creation
* Adding Products: Use Strapi to add new products to the Ecommerce database through the backend CMS.
* Editing Products: Modify information of existing products in the Ecommerce using Strapi and update the changes through the CMS.
* Deleting Products: Remove products from the Ecommerce database through the CMS with a single click.
* Viewing Products: The table clearly and organizedly displays the registered products obtained from Strapi."
